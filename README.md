# VoronoiDiagrams
Voronoi Diagrams using Three.js for Web GL 


To start this app, first download the code to your local machine using `git clone` or the download button. Then, the easiest way to start this is to navigate to this directory and run

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

which will run this program on your local machine at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`. Although depending on your browser, it may suffice to simply run the `index.html`.

Note: Chrome is highly recommended for this demo. Safari works ok.

* Used some of the framework from my Volume Rendering code at [https://github.com/dsherma7/VolumeRendering/](https://github.com/dsherma7/VolumeRendering/).
* Three.JS was used together with WebGL to produce the animations [https://threejs.org/](https://threejs.org/).
* D3 was used as the primary framework for the dashboard and user interface [https://d3js.org/](https://d3js.org/).
